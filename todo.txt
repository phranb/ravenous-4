Get Started
1.
Future parts of this project will implement the Yelp API. That specific functionality 
will require that you pass information from the Yelp API to multiple components. In this project,
 you’ll build the initial portions that will set your project up for this functionality in the future.

2.
In another terminal window, cd into the Ravenous directory and type the following command:

npm start
This command will start a development server and open up a preview of your app in a browser tab. 
As you build, the preview will automatically update when you save your work. 
This is a great way of seeing your progress in real-time.

Create businesses Array
3.
When the Yelp API is implemented, a list of businesses will be returned to App.js. 
Therefore, we should create a hard-coded list of businesses there and then pass them to 
the appropriate components.

Open Business.js. Cut the entire business object and paste it into App.js.

Make sure to paste it right after the imports and above the App class declaration.

4.
Take a look at BusinessList.js. What do you notice about the contents of the BusinessList div?

There’s a lot of repetition here. Specifically, the <Business /> component is repeated six times. 
Recall that we manually did this in the BusinessList component so that we can simulate a list of returned 
business. We’ll refactor this to remove some of the component repetition.

Go back to App.js. Under the business object, create a businesses array. 
The array should hold six references to the business object.

Setting a BusinessList Prop
5.
Remember, our goal is to remove the repetition of components inside of the <BusinessList /> component. 
Let’s add some more functionality to aid this goal.

In app.js, add a businesses property to the <BusinessList /> component inside of the render() method. 
Set the property equal to the businesses array. (Don’t forget your curly braces!)

Add Functionality to the BusinessList Prop
6.
When the businesses prop is set in the BusinessList component, there should 
be some functionality behind it. Specifically, it should iterate through the businesses array. 
Recall that you created an array of businesses in App.js.

Open BusinessList.js. Remove everything inside of the BusinessList div (the repeated components).

Inside of the BusinessList div, access the businesses prop and call the .map() method on it.

7.
Inside of the map() method, pass a callback function with one parameter called business.

8.
The callback function should return a <Business /> component. The returned <Business /> 
should have a property called business. Set the property equal to the parameter 
of the callback function. (Don’t forget your curly braces and semicolon!)

Modifying Business.js using Props
9.
Let’s review what you’ve done so far:

Moved business information to App.js
Created a list of businesses using an array, rather than repeating components in BusinessList.js
Built functionality for the BusinessList component to iterate through the array and return 
Business components
You’re just about done! With the changes you’ve made, however, the Business component will have 
to access business information differently. This is what you’ll build next.

Open Business.js. What do you notice about how information is accessed inside of the return statement?

Because the business object was removed, statements like the following no longer have any meaning:

{business.imageSrc}
Business information now has to be accessed via the business prop you set in BusinessList.js. 
Modify all statements (like the one in the example above) by prepending them with this.props.

Completion and Reflection
10.
Congratulations! You completed the second part of the Ravenous project. Let’s briefly review what you did:

Moved business information to the container component (App)
Passed information from parent components (App) to child components (BusinessList, Business)
This is typical of the flow of information in React apps. 
You’ll continue to build on this structure as you move on to future parts of this project.

Finally, reflect on the knowledge you used in this project. As you do so, 
consider the following questions:

The “Let’s Go” button doesn’t do anything at the moment. How might you simulate a query to the Yelp API?
A user may decide to search with a different sorting option (for example, “Highest Rated”, 
or “Most Reviewed”). How can you handle this change in state using React?
We’ll expand the search bar in the coming weeks to address the questions above (and more).
